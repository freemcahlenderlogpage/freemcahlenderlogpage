Refinancing an installment loan may make sense for a consumer in some instances, but some market practices such as charging large upfront fees and front-loading finance charges disproportionately harm those who do so. Nonrefundable origination fees make the first months of the loan the most expensive for the consumer and the most profitable for the lender if the loan is repaid earlier. Many state laws allow and even encourage these practices rather than requiring that monthly fees be spread evenly over the life of the loan and better align lenders’ and borrowers’ interests. Front-loaded fees give lenders a strong incentive to refinance loans to generate more of these lucrative early months.

Among the refinanced loans examined in this study, a third had cash disbursements of less than the monthly payment amount, meaning that borrowers received less cash than they paid per month before refinancing. Another 14 percent received an amount that was less than two monthly payments. This indicates that these loans were refinanced before borrowers had repaid a substantial share of principal—that is, most of the money they had paid to that point was applied to fees and interest.63 As a result, frequent refinances are harmful to consumers because they substantially increase the cost of borrowing and prolong indebtedness.
