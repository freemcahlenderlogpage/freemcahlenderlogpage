Credit insurance products have extremely low average loss ratios—the share of insurance premium dollars that are paid out as benefits—compared with other forms of insurance.57 Such figures indicate that insurance policies are overpriced and have less value to consumers because companies pay out few benefits relative to the premiums they receive. Insurance with a high loss ratio is considered more beneficial and fairly priced. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which comprises chief state insurance regulators and sets best-practices for insurance companies, recommends a minimum credit insurance loss ratio of 60 percent.58 But the national averages for credit life and disability insurance are 45 and 42 percent, respectively.
