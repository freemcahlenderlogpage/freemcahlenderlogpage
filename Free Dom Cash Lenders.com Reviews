Some insurers have unusually low loss ratios even by credit insurance industry standards. (See Table 4.) For example in 2015, Life of the South Corp., a provider for one of the installment lenders, reported loss ratios of only 53 and 16 percent for credit life and disability insurance, respectively.60 With regard to disability insurance, a proportion of these low loss ratios can be explained by the fact that some claims can be denied later if the borrower is found to have a pre-existing condition or other policy restrictions apply.61

Some state regulators set minimum required loss ratios for credit life and disability insurance, but even in these states loss ratios are often lower than the required minimum.62 For example, the minimum ratios in Texas are already low—43 and 44 percent, respectively, for credit life and disability insurance—but policies in that state still have average five-year loss ratios of 35 and 28 percent, respectively. (See Table 5.) These data suggest that states are frequently lax in enforcing their requirements, and they reinforce the earlier finding that credit insurance products are overpriced and artificially increase the cost of the loan to the benefit of insurance companies and lenders, and the detriment of borrowers.
